# Hand-Gesture-Annotation-on-a-PPT.

Super excited to share my recent project — a real-time hand gesture-powered system to navigate and annotate over PowerPoint slides using just a webcam and Python!

🎯 Key Features:

Control slide navigation with simple gestures (👈👉).

Annotate directly on slides using your index finger as a virtual pen.

Delete annotations with a three-finger gesture ✋.

Overlay live webcam feed for an interactive presenter view.

💡 This project combines:
✅ OpenCV (image processing)
✅ cvzone & mediapipe (hand tracking module)
✅ NumPy (coordinate interpolation and gesture mapping)
✅ Python’s power to seamlessly merge computer vision and user interactivity.

🔍 No need for a touchscreen or laser pointer anymore — your hand does it all! Just plug in your camera, and you’re ready to present like a pro.

🧠 This was an exciting exercise in integrating human-computer interaction with vision-based automation — and a glimpse into smarter, contactless presentation tools!
